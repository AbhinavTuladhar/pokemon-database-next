A Pokémon can only know between one and four moves at a time. No single Pokémon can learn every move; each and every Pokémon has a predetermined set of moves (known as a movelist, movepool, or learnset) that they can learn that relates to the type and concept of the species. Movelist sizes vary greatly among different Pokémon; some Pokémon, such as Ditto and Unown, can only learn one move, while Mew can learn 250 moves in Generation VII, and Smeargle can possess almost any move due to Sketch. Evolved Pokémon generally have larger movelists than their pre-evolved forms but learn moves naturally at a slower rate or even stop learning moves via level-up entirely. This may provide incentive to delay a Pokémon's evolution. Many Legendary and Mythical Pokémon have similar movesets to other Pokémon that are part of the same group (i.e. that are part of the same Legendary duo, trio, etc.).

Moves that do not directly inflict damage are known as status moves. The damaging moves are divided into physical and special moves depending on the individual move's characteristics; the category of the move determines whether the move's damage depends on the user's Attack or Special Attack stat and the target's Defense or Special Defense. Each move has a type that determines how effective it is against various types of targets and whether it receives same-type attack bonus. It is important to note that prior to Generation IV, the move's category was dependent on the move's type, rather than a distinct variable.

When multiple Pokémon attempt to use a move in the same turn, priority and Speed determine the order in which the moves are used. Accuracy affects whether the move misses. The damage dealt by a damaging move is determined by its power, as well as many other variables. Some damaging moves have additional effects. The number of times they can use each move is restricted by the move's PP. The only move that is not affected by Power Points is Struggle. Most moves can target only one adjacent Pokémon, but some moves instead can target the user, more than one Pokémon, or non-adjacent Pokémon.

export const ITEM_LIST_TEXT = `
An item is an object in the Pokémon games which the player can pick up, keep in their Bag, and use in some manner. They have various uses, including healing, powering up, helping one to catch Pokémon, or accessing new areas.

Items are obtained in several different ways. They can be given to the player by characters within the game, be bought at a Poké Mart for money, or found by the player throughout the Pokémon world. The latter form of items are officially referred to as item balls spherical containers resembling a Poké Ball. To obtain the item, players move next to it and press A while facing it. Another method introduced in Generation II is picking Berries off a Berry tree. Join Avenue was introduced in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, allowing players to buy certain items in bulk, as well as Berries and some rare items. Pokémon encountered in the wild will sometimes be holding items, which can be obtained by catching them using a Poké Ball or by using either Trick, Thief, Switcheroo, or Covet. Also, in certain areas in Generation VI, various scenery will appear in the background during some battles.
