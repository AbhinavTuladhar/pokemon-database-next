## About the Project

An 'inspired clone' of the website [pokemondb.net](https://pokemondb.net/) made with the help of the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to display various technical information about Pokémon.

This project was initially written using React and vanilla JavaScript, then written in TypeScript and NextJS.
